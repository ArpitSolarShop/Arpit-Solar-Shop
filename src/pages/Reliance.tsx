          Reliance has committed to an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon
          status by 2035. Our New Energy proposition is key to achieving this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through active investments and partnerships and by building a scalable and
          enabling energy ecosystem, we aim to build one of the world's leading New
          Energy and New Materials businesses that can bridge the green energy divide
          in India and globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The business will be based on the principle of Carbon Recycle and Circular
          Economy with a portfolio of advanced and specialty materials. We aim to create
          a fully integrated manufacturing ecosystem with secure and self-sufficient
          supply chains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our New Energy and New Materials business is uniquely positioned to address
          India’s ‘Energy trilemma’—affordability, sustainability, security—with the
          production of Green Energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          With our indigenous technology ownership and manufacturing capabilities, we
          aim to enable India to transform itself from a net energy importer to a net
          energy exporter.
